# DriverDrowsinessDetector
Real Time Detection of Driver Drowsiness based on the Eyes using WebCam <br>

You will need OpenCV - Version 3.4.1 packages to run this code. <br>
You will need a WebCam to run this script which will detect whether the driver is sleeping based on the eyes. <br>
I am also working on further factors to help improve this system! <br>

Download this repository and run detect.py to run this code!
